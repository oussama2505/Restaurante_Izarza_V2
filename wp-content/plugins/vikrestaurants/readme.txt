== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is upgrading to Pro mandatory? =

No, not at all. However, it took our company 7 years to build the *Pro* version and we are willing to spend a lot more years of work on this software. We encourage you to evaluate the free version first, and then upgrade to Pro to unlock its potential.

= Why some functions are not available in the free version? =

We make money by selling licenses of the Pro version because our goal is to keep Vik Restaurants the best solution for those who need to use it everyday for their business. Maintaining and always developing new features is a heavy cost for our company.

= Is it worth upgrading to Pro? =

Vik Restaurants is not a one-page plugin. You can build websites worth a lot of money thanks to this plugin. You don't need anything else to deliver a complete website, if not a Theme and some experience with WordPress.

= Can I use Vik Restaurants with my preferred Theme? =

Yes, of course. You are free to install Vik Restaurants on your website with your own Theme. The plugin will adjust to it thanks to its own CSS framework. It is also possible to work on a custom CSS file to adjust some layouts.

= Will I lose any contents if I upgrade to Pro? =

Absolutely not. Upgrading to the Pro version is a simple and smooth process. You won't lose any data from your current configuration.

= Can I build a portal of multiple restaurants? =

No you can't. Our Vik Restaurants plugin is able to manage only one restaurant per website. In addition, it doesn't support the features needed to handle a multi-vendor system and the related search functions for the front-end.

= I'm the owner of a restaurants chain, does Vik Restaurants support it? =

Unfortunately it doesn't. As explained in the previous FAQ, Vik Restaurants is not able to handle more than one restaurant per website. This is because the menus, the tables, the products to sell (and so on) always refer to the same owner.

= Is it possible to auto-print the orders when they come in? =

Yes it is, but our client software called VRE Printer is needed in order to connect VikRestaurants with your personal printer. It is mandatory to have also the PRO version of VikRestaurants, since the connection is handled by the API framework.
